# screentime_studyinghours
## **Project Goal**
In this DSA210 term project, I will analyze how my screen time impacts my education by influencing my studying hours. By using factors like total screen usage (both educational platforms and entertainment/social media platforms), academic stress levels, academic responsibilities, sleep duration, and time spent on social activities (including face-to-face interactions), I aim to track my daily screen time and examine its correlation with my studying hours. These factors can influence my screen time by increasing or decreasing it, which in turn may positively or negatively affect the time I plan to study.

## **Motivation**
Screen time plays a crucial role in education through its impact on studying habits. While digital tools and educational platforms can enhance learning, unstructured screen use—especially for entertainment and social media might negatively affect academic productivity. Understanding how my screen habits correlate with my studying hours can help me develop more effective time management strategies. I hope to:
- Identify patterns between screen usage and studying hours to determine whether increased screen time leads to reduced study efficiency or if structured digital engagement enhances learning.

- Analyze how external factors such as academic responsibilities, stress levels, sleep duration, and social interactions influence screen time, potentially affecting my study habits.

- Gain actionable insights into optimizing my screen habits to improve focus, productivity, and overall academic performance.

## **Data Collection & Analysis**
The dataset for this project consists of three months of daily records. 

#### **Data Sources**
- **Date**: The specific day, recorded manually in Excel. 
- **Screen time**: The screen time for both educational and non-educational platforms (hours), recorded from iOS Screen Time Data.
- **Academic stress level**: A self-assessed academic stress level rating (scale of 1–10), recorded manually in Excel. 
- **Academic responsibilities**: Includes the number of homework assignments, exams, and projects, retrieved from academic calendar and recorded manually in Excel.
- **Sleep duration**: Total sleep duration (hours), recorded in Sleep Diary App.
- **Time spent on social activities**: Total time spent (hours), recorded manually in Excel.
- **Studying hours**: Total study hours (in hours), recorded in Toggle Track App.

I will track all data using Excel and Applications that I mentioned to ensure accurate and consistent data collection. External factors such as illness, special circumstances, or unexpected routine changes will be noted and excluded from the analysis to maintain data reliability.

#### **Data Analysis** 

##### **1. Data Preprocessing**
The collected dataset undergoes preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy before analysis. This includes:

- Cleaning and structuring the data recorded in Excel, iOS Screen Time, Toggl Track, and Sleep Diary App.

- Standardizing data formats across different sources for seamless integration.

##### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
- Analyzed distributions of screen time, studying hours, sleep duration, academic stress levels, and social activity time over the recorded period.

- Identified trends in how screen time fluctuates with external factors such as academic responsibilities, sleep patterns, and social interactions.

- Compared educational vs. entertainment screen time usage and its potential impact on studying hours.

##### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examined the relationship between total screen time and studying hours to determine if higher screen time negatively or positively correlates with study efficiency.

- Investigated how external factors (academic stress, responsibilities, sleep duration, and social activities) influence screen time, potentially affecting study productivity.
- Analyzed if specific types of screen usage (educational vs. non-educational) correlate differently with studying hours.

##### **4. Visualization**
- Used graphs, histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent trends and correlations.

- Created comparative charts to analyze the impact of various external factors on screen time and studying hours.
